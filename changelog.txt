Changelog
---------

2012-08-06:  Moved this changelog off the forum post and into a separate file.

2012-08-05 (multiple updates): Rewrote pipeworks to use loops and tables to 
create the nodes. Requires far less code now.  Made the empty/loaded indication 
at the capped end more prominent.  Changed the default pipe segment to the 
aforementioned "short centered" segment, renamed it to just "pipeworks:pipe" 
(and pipe_loaded), added empty/loaded indicator images to the capped ends, 
removed some redundant comments.  Added -X, +X, -Y, +Y, -Z, +Z capped stubs and 
a short centered horizontal segment.

2012-07-21: Added screenshot showing pipes as they look now that nodebox 
texture rotation is fixed.

2012-07-18: Changed the mod name and all internals to 'pipeworks' instead of 
'pipes'... after a couple of mistakes :-)

2012-07-12: moved project to github.

2012-06-23: Initial release, followed by reworking the textures a bit.
